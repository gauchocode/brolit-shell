## :gear: Installation

### IMPORTANT: The script needs to be runned by root.
### Cloud-init
```bash
#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
packages:
 - git
runcmd:
- cd /root/
- git clone https://github.com/gauchocode/brolit-shell
- chmod +x brolit-shell/runner.sh
```

### Manual
Cloning repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gauchocode/brolit-shell
```

Change directories to the new ~/brolit-shell directory:
```bash
cd ~/brolit-shell
```

Give the execution permission to the script:
```bash
chmod +x runner.sh
```

## :triangular_flag_on_post: First steps
Execute BROLIT:
```bash
./runner.sh
```

The first time you run BROLIT, it will prompt you to create a new config file: `~/.brolit_conf.json`. Then open and edit this json file.

## Running as cron job
This script relies on a different configuration file for each system user. The default configuration file location is `/root/.brolit_conf.json`.
This means that if you setup the script with your user and then you try to run a cron job as root, it won't work.

* To setup the script to run as a cron job please use the option "CRON TASKS"

## Running tasks without menu
You can run some tasks like this:
```
./runner.sh --task "cloudflare-api" --subtask "clear_cache" --domain "gauchocode.com"
```
