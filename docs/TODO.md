# TODO List

## For release 3.1

### Know Bugs

- [ ] Nginx: At startup, check if nginx has globals installed.
- [ ] Nginx: If you put a root domain to create a new project, it should ask you if you want to use www subdomain.
             Also, if you use www, it should ask you if you want to use the root domain too.
- [ ] When a certificate expired, the email subject didn't show the Warning message.
- [ ] When restore a backup and change project_name or/and project_domain the script fails:
        - If the main domain detected is a root-domain like mydomain.com the "search and replace" 
          will replace https://www.mydomain.com by https://www.test.mydomain.com
        - If the main domain detected is not a root-domain, will failt to detect a proper project_name
        - If decide to generate new certificate on root-domain, it fails to generate nginx config
- [ ] Project creation fails when use project name like 'myproject_name' (has an underscore).
- [ ] Nginx: New default nginx configuration for wordpress projects fails with after running certbot.
- [ ] Cloudflare: The script should ask you if you want to work with Cloudflare support (also when you create a new project).
- [ ] Cloudflare: If migrate a site with certificates generated by python3-certbot-cloudflare, the certbot will fail.
      Maybe we could ask if it has the proxy enable via Cloudflare API and disable before generate new certificates.
- [ ] Backups: make_project_backup is broken, it needs a refactor!
- [ ] Project Utils: Delete doesn´t work on tools (netdata, phpmyadmin).

### Need more testing

- [ ] It Utils: Alias support for BASH.
- [ ] WordPress: Install fails when set a project name like: xyz_sub_domain.
- [ ] Backups: When restore or create a new project and the db_user already exists, we need to ask what todo (new user or continue?).
- [ ] Installers: On LEMP setup, after basic installation must init plugin options wizard before ask to install aditional packages.
- [ ] Installers: ZSH installer and config.

### In Progress

- [ ] Core: Better structure of deleted projects on dropbox.
- [ ] Nginx: Better nginx config: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/nginx
- [ ] WP-CLI: Better error handling.
- [ ] MySQL: when create a new user, ask what kind of connection do you want: localhost or % (any host).
        Example: CREATE USER 'bruser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'sdasdasas'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bruser'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
