# TODO List

## For release 3.4 (final)

### Know Bugs

- [ ] When restore a backup and change project_name or/and project_domain the script fails:
        - If the main domain detected is a root-domain like mydomain.com the "search and replace" 
          will replace https://www.mydomain.com by https://www.test.mydomain.com
        - If decide to generate new certificate on root-domain, it fails to generate nginx config
- [ ] LetsEncrypt: when delete a certificate, nginx config fails.
- [ ] MySQL: delete user fails if was created different than "USER CREATE 'user'@'localhost'; 
        - Maybe should save user data on /etc/brolit/domain_conf.json
- [ ] Cloudflare: if migrate a site with certificates generated by python3-certbot-cloudflare, the certbot will fail.
- [ ] Cloudflare: if proxy is enable on subdomain, change IP on record will fail.
- [ ] Nginx+WP: if website is configured with root domain like: DOMAIN.com infinite redirects will happen. So we need to check that before create nginx server configuration.
- [ ] Nginx-LetsEncrypt: regenerate nginx server configuration projects fails after running certbot.
- [ ] Notifications: Email HTML breaks sometimes.

### Need improvements

- [ ] Core: need to check if select domain is a root domain or www domain, and ask if the user want to create a redirection.
- [ ] Cloudflare-Certbot: Change proxy mode with Cloudflare API when create a certificate with Cloudflare.
        Also, if you use www, it should ask you if you want to use the root domain too.
- [ ] Nginx-LetsEncrypt: When copy or generate a new nginx server configuration need to check certificates.
- [ ] LetsEncrypt: need a better way to re-install a certificate after a website migration.
- [ ] Project: on project delete, if the script can't find the user, maybe it will be better list all mysql users with database permision (before database deletion).
- [ ] Backups: When restore or create a new project and the db_user already exists, we need to ask what todo (new user or continue?).

### Need more testing

- [ ] Borg support.
- [ ] Core: PHP composer support (installer).
- [ ] Core: Generate project config file (/etc/brolit/domain_conf.json).
- [ ] Postgres: Better postgres support. On "DATABASE MANAGEMENT" Menu, add Database Engine selection.

### In Progress

- [ ] Core: Docker support: backup and restore databases.
- [ ] Core: Flags should receive a json file to deploy or restore a new project.
- [ ] Core: On project creation/restore need to ask first the project stage, then project domain.
        If project stage != prod and subdomains is not containing the stage, need to suggest one.
        Example: test.landing.gauchocode.net OK
        Example 2: landing.gauchocode.net X (OK only if prod).
- [ ] Restore-database: granting privileges to user fails, database_name is empty.
- [ ] PHP: At BROLIT init, if php is installed, check default version.
